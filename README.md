# Guess the Number Game 🎯

## Project Goals 🎯
The goal of this project is to create an interactive and fun "Guess the Number" game with the following features:
- **Difficulty Levels**: Players can choose between Easy, Medium, and Hard modes.
- **Limited Attempts**: Each difficulty level has a set number of guesses.
- **Progressive Levels**: The number range increases after each successful guess, adding a level-up system.
- **Replay Option**: Players can restart the game after finishing.

## Solution 💡
This project uses Python to implement a text-based guessing game. Key features include:
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Customizable difficulty and automatic level progression.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the user provides valid numeric input.
- **User-Friendly Feedback**: The game informs the player whether their guesses are too high or too low.
- **Replay and Continuation**: Offers options to continue leveling up or restart the game.
